## Preface
Hello, world, and welcome to my self-published book, "*Python: Actually Cool Stuff*."

Are you a programmer and wondering what you can *really* do with your code? Are you tired of writing programs that just manipulate numbers and basic strings? Do you want to make something *actually cool* with your skills as a programmer? Well, you're in the right place! 

The goal of this book is to give Python programmers a quick, reference/study for implementing some of the tasks many beginner/intermediate programmer's find daunting, or would like to do but have no idea *how* to do them. Ultimately, you can think of this as a collection of some of my useful Python scripts and packages, and hopefully you'll find use in their existence and knowledge in learning how they function (haha, a pun). 

*Note:* if you're interested in following the development of this book, check out my [TODO
List](https://github.com/zach-king/CoolPython/blob/master/TODO.md) to see
current plans for the book's development.
