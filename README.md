# Python: Actually Cool Stuff
This repository contains the source code for my work-in-progress--a
self-published book, titled "Python: Actually Cool Stuff."

For a quick view at what this book will have to offer, check out the [Table of
Contents](https://github.com/zach-king/CoolPython/blob/master/book/SUMMARY.md). 

## Brief Overview
Are you a programmer and wondering what you can *really* do with your code? Are you tired of writing programs that
manipulate numbers and basic strings? Do you want to make something *actually cool* with your skills as a programmer?
Well, you're in the right place!

The goal of this book is to give Python programmers a quick, reference/study for implementing some of the tasks many
beginner/intermediate programmer's find daunting, or would like to do but have no idea *how* to do them. Ultimately,
you can think of this as a collection of some of my useful Python scripts and packages, and hopefully you'll find use
in their existence and knowledge in learning how they function (haha, a pun).

Check out the [TODO
List](https://github.com/zach-king/CoolPython/blob/master/TODO.md) to see
current plans for the book's development.
