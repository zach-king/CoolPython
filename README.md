# CoolPython
This repository contains the source code for my work-in-progress, self-published book, "Python: Actually Cool Stuff."

## Brief Summary
Are you a programmer and wondering what you can *really* do with your code? Are you tired of writing programs that 
manipulate numbers and basic strings? Do you want to make something *actually cool* with your skills as a programmer? 
Well, you're in the right place! 

The goal of this book is to give Python programmers a quick, reference/study for implementing some of the tasks many 
beginner/intermediate programmer's find daunting, or would like to do but have no idea *how* to do them. Ultimately, 
you can think of this as a collection of some of my useful Python scripts and packages, and hopefully you'll find use 
in their existence and knowledge in learning how they function (haha, a pun).
