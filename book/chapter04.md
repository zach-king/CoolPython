# Chapter 4: Web Scraping
## Summary:

Big data. Big deal. In this chapter, we're going to take a gander at a subject
known as "Web Scraping." What's that you ask? Is that when you crawl the
Internet for days trying to escape the dark web? No, that's called
poor judgement. Web scraping is when a script or program retrieves information
from a website for processing, analyzing, or organizing.

So why did I mention big data? Well, since the computer is retrieving the data
from the website(s), it can get that data and crunch through it pretty quickly.
So, naturally, web scraping is popular among those seeking the usage and analytics
of "big data."
