# Chapter 6: APIs

[Prev: Chapter 5 - GUIs](./chapter05.md) | [Next: Chapter 7 - FTP Client](./chapter07.md)

## Summary:

I often find myself using a service or web browser application, and I think,
"Wow, wouldn't it be awesome if I could somehow use this service for my own
project..." What's this, an...'API' you speak of?

That's right, this chapter is about introducing you to the brilliant topic of
APIs. API stands for Application Program Interface, and is the essential
messenger for how we communicate with certain services and applications. From
a more general definition, you'll be glad to know that a class in Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) is technically an API. In Layman's terms, an API is where the
code has already been written for you, and all you have to do is read up on how to
use it, and then call the right functions.

Say you wanted to build a program that plays music from Pandora and then saves
certain song information on the local machine. Or perhaps you could write an
application that retrieves statistics for League of Legends tournament games.
The first thing you should check with these project ideas is whether or not
the general services being used already have an API or not--and usually they do.
This falls back on the old saying:
> Why reinvent the wheel?

And yes, the previously mentioned examples are both very possible thanks to APIs.
Thus, this chapter will cover a few simple APIs, how to authenticate in order to
use them, and even showcase a full example using a Facebook API. So without
further ado...
