# About the Author

Hi, my name is Zachary King. I am the humble author of this self-published book--my first book. 
At the time of the writing of this book, I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at 
the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. 

I have always had a close bond with programming, ever since I began teaching myself the skill in the tenth grade of high school. And of course, Python is my (current) favorite programming language, for myriad reasons. 

I have always lived in Arkansas, and have not traveled much yet. I grew up in a small town called Fordyce, which of course offered nothing close to computer science classes in its public school. I always wanted to create my own video games, and was already familiar with computers from an average Joe point of view. So in my tenth grade year of high school I decided to start teaching myself programming via the Internet, using whatever resources I could find. Some might be astonished at self-teaching programming, but thanks to the Internet it's not really a big feat...to be honest.

My hobbies include making games with Unity and C#, literally anything Python, watching movies, playing guitar, and playing games when I get a chance (mostly CS:GO). I'm not the most athletic person, but I also enjoy hitting the gym and the outdoors (when it isn't hot and/or humid here in Arkansas).
