# Chapter 5: GUIs

[Prev: Chapter 4 - Web Scraping](./chapter04.md) | [Next: Chapter 6 - APIs](./chapter06.md)

## Summary:

It's time to get GUI (pronounced 'goo-ee'), and I'm not talking about cookie dough.
This chapter is all about getting started with simple Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) in Python, using the built-in *tkinter* package.

If you've programmed for more than a few hours in your life, you've probably
asked yourself, "What's up with this lame terminal window? When can I start
making 'normal' applications--with windows and buttons!?" Well, now is the
time to start, and--like most things in Python--it's not daunting at all!

In this chapter, you'll get to study some basic concepts with GUI programming,
learn how to use a handful of the basic widgets supplied by tkinter, and
even learn how to make a basic, but functional text editor!
