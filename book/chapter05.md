# Chapter 5: GUIs

[Prev: Chapter 4 - Web Scraping](./chapter04.md) | [Next: Chapter 6 - APIs](./chapter06.md)

## Summary:

It's time to get GUI (pronounced 'goo-ee'), and I'm not talking about cookie dough.
This chapter is all about getting started with simple Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) in Python, using the built-in, cross-platform *tkinter* package.

If you've programmed for more than a few hours in your life, you've probably
asked yourself, "What's up with this lame terminal window? When can I start
making 'normal' applications--with windows and buttons!?" Well, now is the
time to start, and--like most things in Python--it's not daunting at all!

In this chapter, you'll get to study some basic concepts with GUI programming,
learn how to use a handful of the basic widgets supplied by tkinter, and
even learn how to make a basic, but functional text editor!

## Content:

Up until this point you've been using the CLI, or Command-Line Interface, but now I'm going to show you how to upgrade to GUI, or Graphical User Interface. GUI is what you're probably used to for everyday tasks on your PC; you open up your browser, text editor, file explorer--all of these use a GUI. 

The basic concept of a GUI is a application window, or *frame*, which contains more frames and/or widgets. Widgets are everything in GUI programming. They are buttons, text fields, scrollbars, images, checkboxes, etc. There are many GUI packages available for Python, but to keep it simply we'll use Python's built-in tkinter. 

You won't be making any exotic applications with complicated, custom widgets with tkinter, but it certainly gives enough functionality for most projects. To start though, we just want *something*, even if it's just a blank window. So let's do that:
