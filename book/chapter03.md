# Chapter 3: File Encryption

## Summary:

These days everyone carries gigabytes of data on them at all times. Thus, we
face a very important task--keeping that data out of the wrong hands! That's
where the fun of encryption comes in.

You may have seen some examples of encryption before, and perhaps thought it
would be just as hard to write an encryption program as it is to crack the
cipher behind it. But fear not, for nothing is so challenging with Python--seriously,
this chapter will make you look like a genius (but of course you are one...).

So what we'll go through in this chapter is first some basic study of modern
encryption (without the nitty gritty details, which we'll leave for cryptographers).  
Then we'll use a third-party package for Python, known as *PyCrypto*, to write
a very basic encryption/decryption program to use from the command-line.
