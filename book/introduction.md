Hello, and welcome to *"Python: Actually Cool Stuff"*. There may be a few questions
on your mind at this moment, concerning this book, and I would like to first
address those, as follows:  

**Q:** *What will you learn from this book?*  
**A:** After reading this book, you should have a good reference point for future,
larger projects of your own. This book is by means intended to give a firm, complete
understanding of the topics covered, but as introductory and suggestive material to
help kick-start your own usage of such topics.  

**Q:** *What should you know already, before reading this?*  
**A:** This book is certainly not for beginners of the Python language, however
I also strive to keep the complexity of the code to a minimal. It would be best if
you already had the fundamentals under your belt, is all.
